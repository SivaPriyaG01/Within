## 🧠 What is "Within"?

**"Within: A Journey Back to Light"** is a short, atmospheric 2D game built in Unity that takes the player through a deeply personal journey of emotional healing. Over 7 in-game days, the player performs small self-care tasks—guided by a soft, supportive voice that slowly helps them rediscover the will to live, grow, and face the world again.

This game is designed for anyone who needs a moment of peace, encouragement, or simply a reminder that they are not alone.
